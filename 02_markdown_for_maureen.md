|             Jacob Bor             |             Boston, USA             | Over the last 8 years, Nomsa (Maureen) was my host, turned Zulu teacher, turned sister and friend. I always looked forward to spending time with her when I was in Mtubatuba, and I believe she did the same. She was the heart and spirit of Ilala, filling its halls with her laughter and song. She was joyful and humble, spiritual and hopeful, a patient teacher and generous friend. We were born months apart and our journeys have been very different, yet I cherish the time we had together. It pains me that Maureen was unable to fulfill her dreams of seeing more of the world before her passing. I am beside myself with grief and will miss her deeply. When next in Mtubatuba, I will pay a visit to the garden we once planted together (before the monkeys got to it:) ). I hope in my deepest of hearts that Maureen's dictum rings true: that for friends, there are no goodbyes, only see-you-laters.Your friend, Jacob |
